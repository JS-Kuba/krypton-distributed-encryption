Krypton - Distributed Processing project

The project is to create a Python application that encrypts a long text using a symmetric key encryption algorithm RC4, utilizing multiprocessing to distribute the encryption task across N different worker machines connected through a network. The ciphertext will be saved to the file in the correct order and decrypted again by worker machines.
